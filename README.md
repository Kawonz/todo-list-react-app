# <a name="todo-list"></a> Todo List
> This <b>todo list</b> website was created using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React js.</a>
<br><br>
This <b>todo list</b> was created to eliminate the need to create a todo list on paper. Some of my peers scrammble looking for a scratch piece of paper. That can be time consuming!
I created this todo list to allow myself and my peers to have a simple, yet powerful experience to keep track of our tasks.
